# A Guide to Abstract Writing

During my time working at the Louisiana STD/HIV Program, I submitted many abstracts to conferences related to perinatal HIV and congenital syphilis. I felt that most of these abstracts were important and useful (at least one (insert link), I feel, was not). This guide is written to encourage burgeoning scientists to explore research in which they feel is important and is useful. 

## Idea
Most, if not all, ideas come while we are thinking in 'diffuse mode', essentially when we are letting our thoughts wander. See [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/course/learning) at Coursera for more information about how to access diffuse mode. Some great thinkers, such as Dali and Thomas Edison had interesting tricks to access this mode of thinking. I take a lot of walks.

## Exploratoration
Ideas can be exciting. Use this excitement to get some initial work done on your project. Look at research in this area, has someone already completed your analysis? Run simple analyses (and make them reproducible).  Ask friends what they think of the idea and want to help with the project.

## Motivation
Motivation is often essential to getting work done. In my previous work, I was motivated by the fact that my work would help to reduce perinatal HIV and congenital syphilis in one of the states most affected by these diseases. Sometimes, however, it helps to have more a more physical motivation, like a deadline towards which to work. After your exploratory analysis, it might be helpful to look for conferences which would provide you with an opportunity to present your work. 

Don't think at this point that your research is important or useful... you haven't completed it yet. Thinking about how and where you might eventually to present your work simply forces you to think about it in a more real (less abstract) way. You could also find annual deadlines for abstracts and this could provide you with a goal on when a potential abstract could be ready.
